In this HTML structure:

The <header> section contains a heading to welcome visitors to your blog.
The <main> section contains a <div> with the id="blog-container". This is where the blog entry cards will be dynamically added by your JavaScript code.
The <footer> section contains a simple copyright notice.
You can customize this structure further and add additional elements and styling as needed for your blog's main page. The JavaScript code in script.js will fetch the blog entry files and create cards within the "blog-container" div as specified in your previous discussions.

Please note that the styles.css reference is optional but can be used to add custom styling to your blog's main page if desired.
